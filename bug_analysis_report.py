print("-" * 60)
print("LOCATION: /Users/diyagamah/Documents/fpltips/src/my_team.py")
print("METHOD: _analyze_captain() lines 147-170")
print()
print("PROBLEM:")
print("- Goalkeepers have NaN values for 'prob_goal' and other attacking metrics")
print("- Line 151: score += player['prob_goal'] * 5")
print("- When prob_goal is NaN: score = NaN * 5 = NaN")
print("- Line 162: sorted(captain_scores, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)")
print("- In Python, NaN comparisons always return False")
print("- With reverse=True, NaN values are sorted FIRST (highest priority)")
print()
print("EVIDENCE:")
print("- np.nan > 8.25 returns False")  
print("- np.nan < 8.25 returns False")
print("- This causes NaN values to be treated as 'largest' when reverse=True")

print("SOLUTION:")
print("- Use fillna(0) before calculations, like main.py does correctly:")

print("- Line 238: recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: (-x.priority, -x.score_improvement))")
print("- Priority values: 1=urgent, 2=recommended, 3=optional")
print("- Using -x.priority means: -1 > -2 > -3")

print("EVIDENCE:")
print("- Saka (injured, priority=1) was ranked 3rd")
print("- Petroviƒá (optional, priority=3) was ranked 1st")
print("- Sort keys: Petroviƒá (-3, -0.38), Saka (-1, -2.42)")
print("- Since -1 > -3, Saka should come first, but algorithm is backwards")
print()
print("SOLUTION:")
print("- Change line 238 to: recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: (x.priority, -x.score_improvement))")
print("- This will sort by priority ascending (1 first), then score descending")
